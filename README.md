# CryptoWallet
Application shows information about different crypto currency, you can also create your crypto portfolio, where you can store your crypto currency and see different information about it, for example check value of your portfolio.

Application uses free API: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation
since API is free, application can send limited requests(10-20), so it is possible, that if you load app many times in short period, api may stop responding and you will
have to wait around 10 minute for application to resume functioning.
Application is made with Combine and it is also using CoreData to store information.
